# Docs Viewer

Serves the current project's `docs/` folder as a local web app: an editorial
"publication cover" board (progress panel, core-document shelf, phases as
numbered chapter columns, specification cards) and a paper-sheet reader page
per markdown document. Read-only; it never modifies project files.

## How to run

1. Confirm a `docs/` folder exists at the project root. If not, tell the user
   and stop.
2. Pick a port: default `4488`. If busy (`lsof -nP -iTCP:4488 -sTCP:LISTEN`),
   use the next free one (4489, 4490, ...). If the busy port is already this
   viewer for this same project (check the output of `curl -s
   localhost:<port>/api/state` for the matching `projectName`), just give the
   user the URL — do not start a second server.
3. Start it in the background from the project root (cwd matters — the server
   reads `<cwd>/docs`):

   ```bash
   DOCS_VIEWER_PORT=4488 node .claude/skills/docs-viewer/assets/server.mjs
   ```

   Or simply `npm run docs:view` in this project.

4. Verify with `curl -s http://localhost:<port>/api/state` (expect JSON with
   `projectName` and `stats`), then give the user the URL.

`DOCS_DIR=/path/to/docs` overrides the docs location if a project keeps docs
elsewhere.

No dependencies are installed — the markdown renderer is bundled inside this
skill (`assets/vendor/marked.umd.js`). Fonts load from Google Fonts and fall
back to system fonts offline.

This skill lives in the repo's `.claude/skills/` and travels with the project.
To use it in another project, copy the `docs-viewer/` folder into that repo's
`.claude/skills/` (it is self-contained).

## Conventions the viewer understands

Everything below is optional; the viewer degrades gracefully (no roadmap →
documents-only view; no status log → everything shows "Not started").

- `docs/*.md` — core documents (shelf in the hero panel). Titles come from
  well-known names (prd.md, tdd.md, api-contract.md), else the file's first
  `# heading`, else the filename.
- `docs/roadmap/phase-<N>-<slug>/` — one board column per phase, ordered by N.
  - `overview.md` — phase title from its `# Phase N: Title` heading.
  - `<N>.<M>-<slug>.md` — one card per specification. Card metadata is read
    from a leading `# PRD: N.M — Title` heading and `**Priority:** /
    **Depends on:** / **Estimated scope:**` lines when present.
- `docs/roadmap/status-log.md` — the single source of truth for delivery
  status. A spec is "Delivered" iff the log contains an entry heading of the
  exact form:

  ```
  ## YYYY-MM-DD — N.M Title — ✅ Complete
  ```

  The entry's body is shown in the reader under a "Status log" tab on that
  spec's page.

The page polls every 5 seconds and reads files fresh from disk on every
request, so edits to any doc or the status log appear without restarting.

## If a project's docs layout differs

Do not edit the skill's assets to fit one project. If the structure deviates
only slightly (e.g. different status-log heading punctuation), suggest
aligning the docs with the convention above. For a genuinely different layout,
copy `assets/` into the project (e.g. `scripts/docs-viewer/`) and adapt the
copy's parsing there.
